Classroom_Management_System
This is a college Mini project for Software Engineering

Description of project

This project is based on a classroom Management System similar to Google classroom which we see in real life.

This project consists of Professors, Students users-related kinds of stuff anyone can create classes and join classes using the security key/id provided, Post their Announcements, As we have authenticated login through google so we have better security.

users can see their To-do List and Sync their tasks with google calendar TA's/Professors can assign Assignments and grade them and can have private comments also. Any announcement would come by mail also.

Requirements

We have used React framework, React js, Javascript, Firebase Technologies, and Material UIUI, Visual Studio Code, NPM.

All user id and passwords used in the project:

As we have directly synced it with google authentication you can only sign in with a google account from this user security level increased.

How to install Just you have to clone the project in one folder on your local PC

how to clone the repository from git? You can search this on youtube or google.

when you are done with this.

How to execute etc.

open your folder In visual Studio code. We have made this on visual studio code so it could be easy to access there.

if it is not downloaded?

Search: Visual studio code download

when you are done with this:

Open your VSC with the correct directory and open the folder with VSC. Open terminal: - and see directory if it is proper type:

npm install

it will take 4-8 minutes to install and then type when it installs:-

npm start

the run machine starts and is ready to deploy it, it redirected it to your default browser with https://localhost:3000

IT Starts ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ƒ




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
